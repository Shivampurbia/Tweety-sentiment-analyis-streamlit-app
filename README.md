# Tweety-sentiment-analyis-streamlit-app
An app  that can perform sentiment analysis on tweets of any hot topic

The requirements.txt includes some other packages too because of some other projects
but the  main packages are:

1. Tweety -  python API for accesing the twiter data
2. NLTK - sentiment analysis model and cleansing
3. matplotlib - for plotting the piechart
4. Streamlit - major package that will help us run the python scripts as webpages
5. Streamlit sharing - used to Host this on Web.

Thank you.
